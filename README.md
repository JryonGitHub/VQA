# VQA

Visual Question Answering in PyTorch


## Setup

We use Pipenv since it is the Python recommended way of managing dependencies.

- Create your virtual environment and install all your dependencies with

    `pipenv install`

- Download the VQA (2.0) dataset from [visualqa.org](http://visualqa.org/)
- I have already pre-processed all the COCO images using VGG-16. You can find them [here]().


## Running

To run the code, just type `python main.py <options>`.

You can get a list of options with `python main.py -h`.
